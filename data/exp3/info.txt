2 datasets * 6 depths * 5 bins * 1 hours * 10 CV -> 800 hours

ASP-POTASSCO
SAT20-MAIN

From this experiment set, I decided to use 3-bins and max-depth 3 with hypersolving that would choose between all depths between 0 and 3 and all values of nodes possible for the specific depth.

We see how for the smaller dataset (SAT20-MAIN) the model overfits for higher depths.
Depths > 3 may help for bigger datasets, but runtime does not scale well.
